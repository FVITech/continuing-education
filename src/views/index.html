                        <h3>Yanet Gonzalez, Medical Assistant</h3>
                        <p>"FVI helped me to accommodate my externship hours around my busy schedule. Today, for more than a month, <strong>I am working as a Medical Assistant in a doctor office</strong>, in which I performed EKG, Phlebotomy, Data entry, Vital signs etc. It is a great opportunity to put into practice the good knowledge I acquired in School and they are happy with my work telling me that I am a good worker. My doctor is satisfied with my work and my patients respect and trust me."</p>

                        <p>"I’m graceful to FVI and all professors like Victor Moreno and Randy Ferrer for providing me with skills and abilities that helped <strong>open the doors to a world full of new opportunities</strong>. Coding literally changed my life and has become a powerful tool to grow and improve my life in several aspects. Excellence, knowledge, respect, dedication are the things you’ll find every step of the learning process."</p>

                        <p>"When I started school I didn’t have the slightest idea of how much I would learn, I started the course without knowing anything about healthcare and the care that it requires. I did not want to know anything about being in hospitals, but as the time was passing, I became passionated about what I was learning. I had some excellent teachers who shared with me and my colleagues their knowledge and encouraged us learn. <strong>Now I work for Miami Cerebral Palsy as Direct Support Apprentice</strong> (DSA) applying what I learned, and I feel very happy."</p>
